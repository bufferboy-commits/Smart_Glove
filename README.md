# Smart_Glove
Smart-Glove is an IoT device which focuses on aiding the deaf and dumb by enabling sign language to speech. It uses flex sensors to determine the bend in fingers, an IMU for getting the orientation, an ESP32 to record the data which is then sent to firebase where a proper letter is allotted to the sign, ultimately spoken on phone using tts.
